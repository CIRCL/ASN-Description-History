This project aims to provide a simple way to get the description of an ASN, and
to see the changes over the time.

We use the data provided by cidr-report.org:
http://www.cidr-report.org/as2.0/autnums.html

Server
======

Fetch ASNs descriptions from cidr-report.org, parse the HTML file and populate
a redis database.

Client
======

Query this database to get the description(s) (latest or all).
